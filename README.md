# General info
My project consists of four discord bots, which, while coordinating their actions, work as one well-coordinated team. If one of the bots fails, the rest distribute its duties among themselves. Bots work completely autonomously and do not require tracking themselves. However, it is possible to take control of any of them through a remote client.
The first three bots covered all areas of discord servers.

- Moderation tools
- User entertainment
- User profiles
- Keeping statistics
- Economy

This system has 2000+ users. Every day it is used by an average of 100-150 users. Recently, I launched the fourth bot in development, which will host a full-fledged RPG right in the discord. 

Here I posted two modules from the fourth bot which is currently being developed. I attach the most abstract modules in order to avoid opening the specific mechanics embedded in the bot.

As I said before, bots coordinate their actions with a central server. Bots report to this server about their actions. And the server, if it finds out that one of the bots is experiencing difficulties or is not responding, redistributes the load. Each of the first three bots can perform each other's duties.

Remote clients are applications that simply make a request to receive or send messages to a central server. The central server returns data about bots and redirects messages from the client to the bot to which it is addressed. If the message is a command, the bot executes it.

I recently created a mobile application for my project to always be aware of the life of the project.
# About attached libraries
Since the project is already used by a large number of users, I cannot share its source code. However, I can attach two libraries from the bot currently being developed. These libraries are the most abstract in the project, allowing you to demonstrate my coding and architectural design skills without revealing the specific mechanics of the system.

Here are a couple of screenshots taken during the combat system demo. Images generated by the bot:

# Future plans
I regularly release updates for my bots, expanding their functionality. Their audience is constantly growing without ads. Because what my bots can do, no other discord bots can. All spheres of life of any discord server can be controlled by one bunch of my bots.
